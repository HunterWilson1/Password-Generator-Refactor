Discription:
For this challenge we had to refactor existing code so that the website will generate a password based off of the criteria presented to the user. first I listed out const variables that I will be using as the criteria. Then I made a function that will make the password based off of the criteria the user selects. After that there is an if statement that if you choose none of the criteria it asks you to atleast choose one. Then some math to assure randomness of teh password.
